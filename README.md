# LynShen CLI

LynShen CLI is a compact coding-agent CLI for repository work. It provides an interactive terminal UI, a headless JSONL mode, context-aware editing tools, lightweight subagents, and real token-usage reporting.

The project is intentionally small: the agent harness is designed to give the model enough autonomy to implement and verify tasks without loading a large framework prompt or exposing high-noise tools by default.

## Highlights

- **Interactive TUI by default** for day-to-day coding tasks.
- **Headless mode** for benchmarks, CI experiments, and scripted agent runs.
- **Context-efficient tool outputs** with projected read/bash/diff-like edit results and saved full outputs when needed.
- **Real token accounting** for input, cached input, output, reasoning, and tokenizer-counted context usage.
- **Parallel read-only/tool inspection** for independent file reads, searches, listings, and shell checks.
- **Scoped editing tools**: exact replacement, hashline edits, full-file writes, and patch application.
- **Large-output controls**: bash output truncation, ripgrep soft warnings, and `read` offset/limit support.
- **Conversation compaction** based on tokenizer-counted context, not rough character estimates.
- **Branchable sessions, resume, checkout, goals, lifecycle-managed skills, full MCP, and lightweight subagents**.
- **TUI diff display without exposing `diff` as an agent tool**.

## Installation

Prebuilt binaries for macOS (Apple Silicon and Intel), Linux x64 and Windows x64
are published on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/LynShen-Team/LynShen-CLI/releases/latest)
and on npm:

```bash
npm install -g @lynshen/cli
lynshen
```

[LynShen Desktop](https://github.com/LynShen-Team/LynShen-Desktop) ships its own copy
of the CLI in `~/.lynshen/bin` and updates it with the app.

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LynShen-Team/LynShen-CLI.git
cd LynShen-CLI
cargo build --release
./target/release/lynshen
```

### With Cargo from Git

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/LynShen-Team/LynShen-CLI.git lynshen-cli
lynshen
```

LynShen is written in Rust and uses the workspace binary name `lynshen`.

### Updating

LynShen checks for new versions at startup and prints a notice when one is
available. Update with:

```bash
lynshen update
```

- npm installs run `npm i -g @lynshen/cli@latest` (on Windows right after the
  process exits, since the running executable is locked).
- Release binaries download the new binary from GitHub Releases, or from the
  LynShen server when GitHub is unreachable or slow, verify it and replace
  themselves; the new version runs from the next start.
- The copy LynShen Desktop keeps in `~/.lynshen/bin` updates with the app.

## Configuration

On first run, LynShen creates its configuration under the user profile directory. By default it targets the LynShen gateway (an OpenAI-compatible Responses API):

- default provider: `lynshen`
- default model: `gpt-5.5`
- default API base URL: `https://api.lynshen.net/v1`
- default API key environment variable: `OPENAI_API_KEY`

Sign in with `/login` to use the LynShen gateway, or set an API key and point the config at any compatible endpoint. Built-in provider templates: `lynshen` and `openai` (Responses), `deepseek` (Anthropic Messages), and `ollama` and `openrouter` (Chat Completions). List them with `lynshen providers`, or override the `protocol` setting for custom endpoints:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="..."
lynshen
```

The vendored provider catalog adds the subscription and cloud endpoints on top of those templates:

- `openai-codex` — ChatGPT Plus/Pro subscription, signed in with `/login openai-codex` (browser flow on `localhost:1455`). Requests go to the Codex backend (`https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex/responses`) with the ChatGPT workspace taken from the token.
- `azure` — Azure OpenAI deployments. Set `provider` and your own `base_url` (e.g. `https://<resource>.openai.azure.com/openai/v1`) in `config.json`, put the key under `providers.azure` in `auth.json`, and requests go to `/responses?api-version=…` with the `api-key` header. `AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION` overrides the default `v1`.

You can switch model and reasoning effort inside the TUI:

```text
/model gpt-5.5 medium
/model gpt-5.4-mini low
/effort high
```

`ctrl+t` cycles the effort for the current model; inside the `/model` picker, `tab` cycles it for the highlighted model.

The config also supports custom OpenAI-compatible base URLs, retry settings, model metadata, and project-instruction discovery.

On the LynShen gateway, each model's context window, output cap and effort levels come from the gateway; values it does not set stay unknown rather than guessed. `context_window_overrides` in `config.json` (`{"<model>": tokens}`) sets a window by hand: it fills in a missing one or raises the advertised window up to the gateway's largest. With no known window LynShen does not compact on a guess; when the model rejects a request as too long, it compacts and retries the turn.

### Edit tools (`edit_tools`)

The default edit tool is `hashline_edit`; the other edit tools are off unless you enable them. The `edit_tools` array in `config.json` controls which edit tools the model sees (and may execute):

```json
"edit_tools": ["hashline_edit", "str_replace", "write", "apply_patch"]
```

Valid names are `hashline_edit`, `str_replace` (alias `edit`), `write`, and `apply_patch`. Omitting the field enables only `hashline_edit`; an empty array disables all edit tools. Disabled edit tools are not sent to the model and return a clear error if called anyway. Non-edit tools (`read`, `bash`, `ls`, `ripgrep`, `outline`, `checkpoint`, and so on) are not affected by this field.

File tools (read/write/edit/ls/outline/checkpoint/apply_patch) only operate on paths inside the working directory: absolute paths, `..`, and symlinks that resolve outside the workspace are rejected with a clear error. This is a path policy, not an OS sandbox — shell commands are not restricted by it.

### Approval modes

`approval_mode` in `config.json` (or `/permissions <mode>` in a session; `shift+tab` cycles modes) picks one of four levels:

| Mode | File edits | Shell commands |
|---|---|---|
| `manual` (default) | ask | ask |
| `auto-edit` | run freely | ask |
| `auto` | run freely | a safety model auto-approves safe commands; the rest still ask |
| `full-access` | run freely | run freely, no prompts |

Under `auto`, every shell command first goes through a one-shot safety classification in an isolated context — the classifier sees only the command, the working directory, and your request, never the conversation history. Commands it judges safe run immediately; anything unsafe, ambiguous, or a failed classification falls back to the interactive prompt. The classifier model is configured with `safety_model` (defaults to `compact_model`) and `safety_reasoning_effort` in `config.json`:

```json
"safety_model": "gpt-5.4-mini",
"safety_reasoning_effort": "low"
```

`full-access` runs the model's shell commands and file writes with your user permissions and no prompts — `bash` is not confined to the workspace, so only use it for tasks and repositories you trust.

## Usage

### Interactive mode

Run LynShen in a repository:

```bash
cd path/to/project
lynshen
```

Then ask for implementation, debugging, refactoring, or verification work in natural language.

Useful commands:

```text
/help                         show command summary
/login [web-url] [api-url]    login and sync marketplace defaults
/model [model] [effort]       view or change model and reasoning effort
/effort [effort]              cycle or set reasoning effort
/permissions [mode]           view or change the approval mode
/tree                         show branchable session tree
/resume [session-id]          resume a previous session
/context                      inspect context and token statistics
/goal <objective>             start or update a persistent goal
/skills list                  list marketplace skills
/skills install <id>          install a skill
/skills update <id>           update an installed skill
/skills enable|disable <id>   toggle an installed skill
/skills uninstall <id>        remove an installed skill
/skills sync                  sync default skills
/pin <skill>                  keep a skill in current session context
/mcp                          show MCP server status
/image <path>                 attach an image to your next message
/compact                      compact older conversation context
/quit                         exit
```

Installed and project-local skill behavior is documented in [docs/skills.md](docs/skills.md).
MCP stdio/HTTP setup, prompt commands, resource tools, roots, and HTTP authentication are
documented in [docs/mcp.md](docs/mcp.md).

Other TUI conveniences:

- **`!` shell escape** — input starting with `!` (for example `!git log -3`) runs in your local shell and shows its output in the history; it is never sent to the model.
- **`@` file mentions** — type `@` plus a few characters to fuzzy-pick a project file (gitignore-aware via `rg --files`, falling back to `git ls-files` or a capped walk); Tab/Enter inserts the path.
- **Git status bar** — the bottom bar shows the current branch with a `*` dirty marker, refreshed by a cheap cached `git` call on a background thread.
- **Custom commands** — Markdown prompt files in `~/.lynshen/commands/*.md` appear as `/name` commands; project-local `.lynshen/commands/*.md` load after you trust the project (same gate as skills). `$ARGUMENTS` in the file body is replaced with whatever you type after the command.
- **Images** — paste or drag-and-drop an image file path into the TUI (it attaches automatically), or use `/image <path>`.

### Headless mode

Headless mode emits JSONL events and finishes with a `final_result` event containing status, usage, context, tool-call counts, and elapsed time.

Headless runs default to the `manual` approval mode: tool calls that would need interactive approval (edits, shell commands) are auto-denied with a clear message instead of hanging. Pass `--approval-mode` explicitly for tasks that change files or run commands:

```bash
lynshen --headless --approval-mode full-access "Fix the failing test and verify the focused suite"
```

Read-only tasks work without a flag:

```bash
lynshen --headless "List the repository structure and stop."
```

You can also pipe the task through stdin:

```bash
cat task.md | lynshen --headless
```

`full-access` runs the model's shell commands and file writes with your user
permissions and no prompts — `bash` is not confined to the workspace, so only
use it for tasks and repositories you trust.

The `final_result` event reports the effective `approval_mode` and how many approvals were auto-denied.

This mode is useful for evaluation harnesses and reproducible agent experiments. A minimal in-repo harness lives in [`evals/`](evals/README.md).

### Daemon (`lynshen daemon`)

`lynshen daemon` is the local background service LynShen Desktop and the LynShen web app talk to (`ws://127.0.0.1:7788`). It hosts every session — LynShen's own engine, Claude Code, Codex and ACP agents — translated into one event stream, plus long-lived agents with schedules, and keeps them running when no window is open. With remote access turned on it also holds an end-to-end encrypted relay connection for the web app. The protocol is documented in [docs/daemon-protocol.md](docs/daemon-protocol.md).

`lynshen logout` signs this computer out of LynShen and revokes its device.

### ACP mode (`lynshen acp`)

`lynshen acp` speaks the [Agent Client Protocol](https://agentclientprotocol.com) (JSON-RPC over stdio) so ACP-capable editors such as Zed can drive LynShen as an external agent. It maps prompts, streaming message/thought chunks, tool-call progress, plan updates, cancellation, and permission requests; features ACP cannot express (session loading, hunk-subset approvals, the conversation tree) are explicitly rejected rather than half-implemented. `lynshen serve` (the native newline-JSON protocol) is unchanged and remains the richer interface; its command/event schema is documented in [docs/serve-protocol.md](docs/serve-protocol.md).

## Agent tools

LynShen exposes a small set of direct tools to the model:

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `read` | Read text, image metadata/payload, or binary metadata. Supports `offset` and `limit`. |
| `hashline_edit` | Patch lines using stable `LINE#HASH` anchors from `read`. The only edit tool enabled by default. |
| `str_replace` | Apply exact targeted replacements after reading a file. Off by default; enable via `edit_tools`. |
| `write` | Create new files or overwrite previously read files. Off by default; enable via `edit_tools`. |
| `apply_patch` | Apply a unified patch when targeted edits are awkward. Off by default; enable via `edit_tools`. |
| `bash` / `exec_command` | Run shell commands with timeout, sessions, output truncation, and progress updates. |
| `write_stdin` | Poll or send input to a running shell session. |
| `ls` | List directory entries. |
| `ripgrep` | Search with ripgrep and optional limits. |
| `outline` | Get lightweight source-file symbols without reading full bodies. |
| `checkpoint` | Create/list/restore local `.lynshen/checkpoints` snapshots. |
| `spawn_agent`, `wait_agent`, `list_agents`, `send_message`, `close_agent` | Coordinate lightweight subagents. |

`diff` is intentionally not exposed as an agent tool. Edit tools still return diff data for the TUI and for compact model-facing summaries, but workspace diff inspection should happen through scoped shell commands when needed.

## Context and token efficiency

LynShen focuses on reducing unnecessary context growth without hiding useful information:

- tool outputs have separate full output and model-projected output paths;
- large command output is truncated before entering model context;
- large reads return soft guidance to use `offset`, `limit`, `outline`, or `ripgrep`;
- large edit diffs are summarized for the model while the TUI can still display useful change previews;
- tokenizer-counted context is used for context statistics and compaction thresholds;
- prompt-cache usage is reported from real API usage, including cached input tokens.

## Evaluation snapshot

The following numbers come from the local `agent-eval` **test set** run on 2026-06-09. The set contains five representative multi-step tasks:

- three SWE-style issue-regression tasks in existing open-source projects;
- one greenfield TypeScript library task;
- one greenfield frontend dashboard task.

The comparison used the `agent-eval` harness's aggregated test-set results (the harness lives in a separate internal repository and is not included here). Treat these as a reproducible local snapshot, not a universal public benchmark.

| Agent | Passed | Input + output tokens | Output tokens | Reasoning tokens | Raw cache rate | Filtered cache rate |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| LynShen | 5/5 | 735,437 | 16,028 | 1,657 | 66.5% | 80.5% |
| Codex baseline | 5/5 | 1,082,512 | 24,847 | 2,109 | 81.3% | 81.3% |
| OpenCode | 5/5 | 1,095,558 | 24,045 | 699 | 62.2% | 74.7% |
| PI | 5/5 | 372,037 | 20,382 | 0 | 36.4% | 71.9% |
| Reasonix | 4/5 | 1,586,304 | 18,311 | 0 | 68.4% | 68.4% |

In this test-set snapshot, LynShen completed all five tasks and used **347,075 fewer input+output tokens than the Codex baseline**, a **32.1% reduction**. After excluding zero-cache noise requests, LynShen's cache rate was **80.5%**, close to the Codex baseline's **81.3%**.

## Development

Run the full Rust test suite:

```bash
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
```

Build the CLI:

```bash
cargo build -p lynshen-cli
```

Run a quick headless smoke task:

```bash
./target/debug/lynshen --headless "List the repository structure and stop."
```

## Project status

LynShen CLI is an active experimental coding-agent harness. The current direction is to keep the framework small, improve task completion reliability, and optimize context quality rather than adding broad agent abstractions.
